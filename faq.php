					<h5>What's it like to be in a business fraternity?</h5>
					<p>Membership in Alpha Kappa Psi has both the social and philanthropic opportunities of a social fraternity, while providing you the opportunity to develop yourself professionally. Brothers begin their development during the recruitment process, continuing to learn as a pledge and as a Brother. Our Fraternity offers leadership experience through case competitions and internships, opportunities to learn professional skills through etiquette dinners and business conferences, and will teach you how to network and how to leverage those relationships throughout your career.</p>
				</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td colspan="3">
					<h5>Why should I join Alpha Kappa Psi?</h5>
					<p>By bringing together people that share the same field and interests, and further developing their skills and talents in that field, they are able to capitalize on networking, professional development, and furthering every member's careers and opportunities in that given field. Any recruiter will tell you, it's not what you've learned in a classroom that is important; it is your ability to apply that knowledge. A professional fraternity gives you an opportunity to assume leadership positions and to organize and coordinate events to demonstrate your ability to do just that. </p>
				</td>
			</tr><tr>
				<td class="small_cell">

			</tr><tr>
				<td colspan="3">
					<h5>What is the time commitment of pledging?</h5>
					<p>The actual length varies with every semester, but mandatory requirements include attendance at weekly meetings and additional events.

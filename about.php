		<h2><strong>Nu Chapter</strong> at Boston University</h2>
		<div class="seperator"></div>
		<p>Most recently chartered in 2007, Alpha Kappa Psi Nu Chapter has been dedicated to exercising its core values in ways that benefit its members, Boston University, and the Boston Community. Its open professional events range from hosting mock interviews by senior recruiters from companies like Deloitte, PwC, Grant Thornton, and Ernst &amp; Young, to an annual case competition. Nu Chapter also gives back by volunteering at resume workshops for <a href="https://www.dressforsuccess.org/" target="_blank">Dress for Success</a>, and hosting donation drives for the <a href="http://www.salvationarmyusa.org/" target="_blank">Salvation Army</a>. Nu Chapter also has two groups exclusive to the Brotherhood that allow for real-world experience in the consulting and investing fields:</p>
		<p class="indented_text"><br><strong>Nu Chapter Consulting Group (NCCG)</strong> offers pro-bono consulting services to start-ups in the Boston area, and NCCG leaders and associates often go on to pursue a career in consulting with leading firms.<br><br><strong>Elevate</strong> is a group that spearheads initiatives and consults the Boston University administration. Its past projects include creating a Thanksgiving Homestay Program for students, and increasing enrollment to BU's Philosophy department. Elevate provides a platform for brothers to create their own projects which have a real impact on the student body and university.</p>

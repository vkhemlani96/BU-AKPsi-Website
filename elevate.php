			Elevate is a student consulting group that was founded by Alpha Kappa Psi at Boston University in 2013. The group provides consulting services for academic programs and entrepreneurship initiatives. 
			<br><br>
			We have 4 critical advantages:
			<br><br>
		</p>
		<p class="indented_text">
			<strong>1.</strong> <strong>All projects are student initiatives</strong>; therefore, students have a direct voice and impact on how they can enrich student life at Boston University.
		</p><br><p class="indented_text">
			<strong>2.</strong> When a student's idea aligns with Elevate's mission statement, he or she has <strong>the option to build a team</strong>, where the team will oversee their project through maintaining engagement with clients.
		</p><br><p class="indented_text">
			<strong>3.</strong> Elevate has <strong>very minimal hierarchy</strong> &mdash; the Director manages Elevate overall, however project managers may build their own team and work with clients at their own discretion, while maintaining the image and work ethic of Elevate.
		</p><br><p class="indented_text">
			<strong>4.</strong> Elevate is <strong>an opportunity for students to grow</strong>. While participating in Elevate, students will constantly be challenged and will develop skills in areas such as entrepreneurship, negotiation, sales pitches, problem solving, communication, account management, and consulting.
		</p><br><p>
			We are currently seeking to develop additional relationships where Elevate can add value. We welcome you to reach out to us at <a href="mailto:elevatebu@gmail.com">elevatebu@gmail.com</a> to found out more about how we can help implement your ideas.
